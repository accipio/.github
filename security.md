# Security Notice

## What?

This is the security notice for all [Accipio repositories](https://github.com/accipio). The notice explains how vulnerabilities should be reported. At Accipio there are cyber security and information assurance teams, as well as security-conscious people embedded within the workflows, that assess and triage all reported vulnerabilities.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Accipio is an advocate of responsible vulnerability disclosure. If youâ€™ve found a vulnerability, we would like to know so we can fix it. This notice provides details for how you can let us know about vulnerabilities.

You can report a vulnerability by emailing [dev@accipio.com].

When reporting a vulnerability to us, please include:
- the website, page or repository where the vulnerability can be observed
- a brief description of the vulnerability 
- details of the steps we need to take to reproduce the vulnerability
- non-destructive exploitation details

If you are able to, please also include:
- the type of vulnerability, for example, the [OWASP category](https://owasp.org/www-community/vulnerabilities/)
- screenshots or logs showing the exploitation of the vulnerability

If you are not sure if the vulnerability is genuine and exploitable, or you have found:
- a non-exploitable vulnerability
- something you think could be improved - for example, missing security headers
- TLS configuration weaknesses - for example weak cipher suite support or the presence of TLS1.0 support

## Guidelines for reporting a vulnerability
When you are investigating and reporting the vulnerability on a gov.uk domain or subdomain, you must not:
- break the law
- access unnecessary or excessive amounts of data
- modify data
- use high-intensity invasive or destructive scanning tools to find vulnerabilities
- try a denial of service - for example overwhelming a service with a high volume of requests
- disrupt our services or systems
- tell other people about the vulnerability you have found until we have disclosed it
- social engineer, phish or physically attack our staff or infrastructure
- demand money to disclose a vulnerability

Only submit reports about exploitable vulnerabilities through HackerOne.

## Bug bounty
Unfortunately, Accipio doesn't offer a paid bug bounty programme. We will make efforts to show appreciation to people who take the time and effort to disclose vulnerabilities responsibly.
